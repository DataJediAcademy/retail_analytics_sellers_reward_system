# #Retail Analytics: Sellers' Management System
Sellers' Reward System Management Dashboard and Performance Prediction System for an Ecommerce Marketplace Company.

## Brief
<strong>Zimla</strong> is an ecommerce company that offers a marketplace for sellers and buyers.  Sellers sell their products online, while buyers(customers) make purchases and have their orders delivered to them. Being a marketplace, to remain profitable, <strong>Zimla</strong> requires that its sellers be top notch and consistently exceed customers expectation. In recent months, its  call centre has  been receiving customers complains around the delivery of their orders. 

**The CEO would like a comprehensive approach to addressing this challenge hence has recommended that a Sellers' Reward System Management dashboard be created.  He would like  to effectively manage sellers  in real time. He expects that this would  significantly improve customers' reviews and results in increased revenue this  year.**

You are part of a data science consulting start-up that  has been  asked to do a POC to <strong>Zimla's</strong> management team. The outcome of this would determine if your organization would be contracted to implement  the solution for <strong>Zimla</strong>. 

However, there is a little glitch though <strong>Zimla</strong> has  requested that your start-up show case your offering, the CEO would not release its company data, he is sceptical. He thinks data science is all media hype and consulting companies' gimmicks.

Your lead consultant rather than reject this proposal, is determined to make a case for data science.  Through research and consultation with  <strong>Zimla's</strong>  management, he discovered that [Olist Store](https://olist.com/) a similar ecommerce company in Brazil  has made public its ecommerce data from 2016 to 2018 on  100k orders.  With <strong>Zimla's</strong>  permission he would require you and other team members to develop the POC.

> Hello Team,
> 
> We have an opportunity to bring our company's offerings to the retail space. Using the Olist dataset we are to develop a Sellers' Reward System Management Dashboard and Performance Prediction System that would help <strong>Zimla's</strong>  answer the following questions and better serve their customers:
>
> - Who are the sellers we have and what products are they selling?
> - How many orders are each seller getting weekly, monthly, and yearly?
> -	How are the sellers doing with meeting their delivery(logistics) commitment to the customers?
> -	How are the sellers performing in terms of product review?
> -	Where are the sellers located? Geolocation data has been provided.
>   - Where do we have densely populated sellers and where do have few sellers to meet orders?
> -	How does sellersâ€™ location affect delivery services?
> -	Can you discover any seasonality in the products or ordering pattern?
> -	Determine if there is a relationship between customer satisfaction and product type.
> -	Determine if there are sellers who consistently get good review and those who do not.
> -	Determine top performing and least performing sellers by order and sales value.
> -	Can you determine what factors make a seller a top performer and least performer?
> -	Given a product what top sellers would most likely deliver as promised?


>
> I have reviewed the dataset and I strongly believe beyond answering the above questions  for <strong>Zimla</strong>, there are other offerings and product we can propose to the management while making our pitch for this job.  Please I look forward to us including these in our product pitch to them.  

> I know we can do this. Gentlemen & ladies,  it is time to roll up our sleeves.

> Your Lead,

### Tools and Technologies
- Power BI
- Python
- SQL
- Database System 
- Time Series Methodology

### Tasks
1. Create a database system  for the dashboard
2. Create a Power BI dashboard (to answer the questions raised by the Team Lead)
3. using time series methods predict  order level for each seller for 
  - the next day
  - the next 7-days 
4. Using machine Learning  predict the order level and order value per seller for 
  - the next day
  - the next 7-days 
5. Embed your machine learning model in the PowerBI dashboard

### Deliverables
- A  database system
- Dynamic dashboard - Dashboard where a user can interact with the data
- Power Point presentation to Zimla management
  - your slide should contain a recommendation on what reward system can be used to improve sellers' performance
- Jupyter Notebook containing model implementation

### Additional Tasks (compulsory for Data/ML Engineers but optional for Data Scientists)

- Implement a local database system to house your data 
- Deploy your machine learning model as an API in the Cloud
- Test your API using Postman


### Additional Deliverables (compulsory for Data/ML engineers but optional for data scientists)
- Design a system (be as detailed as possible - you do not need to implement this) that would ensure your solution remain up to date with sellers daily records.
  - include your design in your presentation
  - recommend the infrastructure <strong>Zimla's</strong>  should consider investing in to achieve this
